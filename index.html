    <h1> Stage Zero - Getting Started with HTML </h1>
<h3> What is the web?</h3>
<p> The internet was created in the 1980s and now has more than 30 billion pages, mostly HTML documents.  It is the largest computer network in the world.  Web pages are stored on servers.  Browsers on indiviual computers send requests for pages in HTTP through the internet to servers.</p>
<h3> What is HTML? </h3>
<p> HTML, <em> short for hyper text markup language</em>, is the main document type of the web, and is considered the "glue" of the web.  The text content is what is being viewed, and the HTML <em>markup</em> dictates how that content appears on the screen.</p>
<h4> Elements and Tags </h4>
<p> HTML documents are made of <em> elements</em>.  Tags denote the beginning and end of elements.  However, there are many <em> void  elements </em> which do not require an end tag.  Attributes modify elements.</p>  Elements can be inline, block, or container elements.  Inline elements relate to that line of the document.  Block elements form an invisible box around the text they contain, and can have associated height and width.
<h3> Computers are stupid</h3>
<p> Ok, computers are not really stupid.  They simply operate based upon a given set of rules, and require precise input to operate as expected.<p>
